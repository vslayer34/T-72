Thanks for buy this asset.

To get same quality like on screenshoots and video, set quality to highest and make sure that in "Edit->Project setting->Player" Color Space = Linear!!!

Asset has been tested also on Unity 5.6 version.

Issues in "Studio" scene:
1) PostProcess Effects was disabled;
2) Steam has been disabled, to get it work follow next steps (or delete it):

1. Dowload and import Legacy Cinematic Image Effects (Unity 5.5 or later) from asset store, its free;
2. Assets->Import Package->ParticleSystems;
3. Enable GameObject Steam;
4. Enable PostProcess scripts on Main Camera and look at settings in pdf file.


Used add-on in Video (Unity 2017.1.0f3): 

-Legacy Cinematic Image Effects (Unity 5.5 or later) Look at asset store.
-Frame Capture github url: https://github.com/unity3d-jp/FrameCapturer
